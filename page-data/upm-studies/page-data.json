I’m writing it just to share my experience while dealing with UPM and my personal preferences about some NPM systems that we can use in combination with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today I decided to format the document a little bit and share it with the community. It will not be a super technical and well-designed text, but I hope it could help somebody in the same situation I was before.</p>\n<p>My initial intention for that post was to only show my personal pros and cons about some solutions for hosting packages as NPM and being able to install them into our project via the Unity Package Manager + Scoped Registries, but I couldn’t resist my desire to tell a short story about the UPM + Git Dependencies, because I also spent quite some time investigating about it. So here we go!</p>\n<h2>Unity Package Manager + Git Dependencies</h2>\n<p>Back in 2020, I started to create Unity packages and in the learning process, I was disappointed that Unity Package Manager does not work with git dependencies.</p>\n<p>Then, I decided to create a system to resolve Git Dependencies inside custom packages installed in a Unity project via UPM . You can take a look at that package here: <a href=\"https://GitHub.com/sandolkakos/unity-package-manager-utilities\">https://GitHub.com/sandolkakos/unity-package-manager-utilities</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can also take a look at some discussion regarding UPM + Git dependencies on the Unity forums: <a href=\"https://forum.unity.com/threads/custom-package-with-git-dependencies.628390/\">https://forum.unity.com/threads/custom-package-with-git-dependencies.628390/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, at that time I’d seen people talking about scoped registries, but I didn’t pay attention because I was too much focused on the fact that UPM couldn’t resolve git dependencies and decided to create the package above, which was an acceptable solution for the moment being.</p>\n<h2>Unity Package Manager + Scoped Registries</h2>\n<p>About one year later, I was still not comfortable with the fact that to import a list of packages, I would need to copy a git URL for every package. I would really love to see all my packages on the UPM window and just click a button to install all of them.</p>\n<p>Then I ended up having to learn about NPM packages and how to use them on Unity via Unity Package Manager + Scoped Registries. You can read about it here:\r\n<a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html\">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html</a></p>\n<p>If you are familiar with NPM packages, you will notice that Unity does not handle the package names the same way as the big majority of the other tools manage to do.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Instead of: @companyname/packagename\r\nUnity uses: com.companyname.packagename </code></pre></div>\n<p>Because of that, I lost a lot of time trying to figure out how to make Unity work with GitLab Package Registry, for instance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We can use GitLab to host Unity Packages but unfortunately, the packages would never get listed on the UPM window.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So every time I was trying different settings, different package names (with and without the <code class=\"language-text\">@companyname/</code>), always thinking that my settings were wrong but in the end, I just found out that the way Unity requests the list of packages is not supported by GitLab and other NPM Registry services, like NPMJS, GitHub, AWS CodeArtifact, and so on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When using <strong>Verdaccio</strong> and <strong>JFrog</strong> registries, the Unity Package Manager will list all the packages and I’m gonna talk about them in that document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, after a lot of time trying different stuff, I had an idea of using the menu below to add a package by name while my GitLab Scoped Registry URL was added to Unity Package Manager settings, and “voilà”! the package was installed with success.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 443px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/my-blog/static/cd4bce657ad628e34d9ea6fc3e6564d7/a120c/add-package-by-name.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51.89873417721519%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Add package by name…\"\n        title=\"Add package by name…\"\n        src=\"/my-blog/static/cd4bce657ad628e34d9ea6fc3e6564d7/a120c/add-package-by-name.png\"\n        srcset=\"/my-blog/static/cd4bce657ad628e34d9ea6fc3e6564d7/c26ae/add-package-by-name.png 158w,\n/my-blog/static/cd4bce657ad628e34d9ea6fc3e6564d7/6bdcf/add-package-by-name.png 315w,\n/my-blog/static/cd4bce657ad628e34d9ea6fc3e6564d7/a120c/add-package-by-name.png 443w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>That also means, that if your packages have dependencies to each other or to packages from Unity Registries or any other Scoped Registries added to your project, Unity can resolve all the dependencies properly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The UPM will not list the “unknown” packages, but as soon as the package name is informed, be it by adding the package name manually or by another package requesting it via dependency, it will just work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that solution, both the projects and packages could be hosted on the same service, for instance, GitLab or GitHub. For some people that would be enough, but not for me, so I needed to try more solutions.</p>\n<p>For me, the perfect match would require the solution to have those features:</p>\n<h5>The host:</h5>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- An NPM registry to host the packages\r\n- Private for defined users\r\n- History of package versions</code></pre></div>\n<h5>The client:</h5>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- All packages hosted in the registry should appear in the UPM window\r\n- The dependencies should be automatically resolved</code></pre></div>\n<hr>\n<h2>Investigation Results</h2>\n<p>I’ve tested 5 systems and described the Pros/Cons for every one of them. My personal ranking of better solutions based on my investigation is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>JFrog</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Verdaccio + GitLab</strong> <em>(using Uplink)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Verdaccio</strong></li>\n<li><strong>GitLab</strong></li>\n<li><strong>AWS CodeArtifact</strong></li>\n<li><strong>NPMJS</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3>Verdaccio</h3>\n<p>Verdaccio is an open-source NPM application that we can install on a Linux server and then be able to publish and install NPM packages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verdaccio website: <a href=\"https://verdaccio.org/\">https://verdaccio.org/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only issue I have found so far is that when we try to publish a big package, the process of publishing can take a long time and the Socket connection would get a timeout, which makes it not possible to publish the package.</p>\n<p>Maybe there is a way of fixing that issue, but at the moment I have tried multiple settings on the Verdaccio installation and Linux machine and nothing worked.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a feature where we can link multiple external registries to the Verdaccio one. That would give us access to install packages from those registries directly via the Verdaccio connection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://verdaccio.org/docs/linking-remote-registry/\">Linking a Remote Registry | Verdaccio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://verdaccio.org/docs/caching\">Caching strategies | Verdaccio</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was able to link the GitLab registry, and using <code class=\"language-text\">cache: false</code> makes Verdaccio behaves only as a proxy to reach GitLab and download the requested version.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Metadata structure stored by GitLab does not contain most of the details used by the UMP. That means when a package is installed, its name and authour is not properly displayed in the UPM window and the Project.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- displayName: \"com.companyname.packagename\" instead of the display name set in the package.json\r\n- author: \"Packages -
